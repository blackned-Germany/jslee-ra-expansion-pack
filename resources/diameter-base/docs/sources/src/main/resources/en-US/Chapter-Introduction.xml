	<title>Introduction to &THIS.PLATFORM; JAIN SLEE &THIS.RA; Resource Adaptor</title>

	<para>This resource adaptor provides a Diameter API for JAIN SLEE applications, according to Diameter Base protocol, responsible for managing connection between peers and provide an Authentication, Authorization and Accounting (AAA) framework for applications such as network access or IP mobility, as defined by the protocol specs done by the IETF in <ulink url="http://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc3588">RFC 3588</ulink>.</para>
	<para>Events represent Diameter Base messages received by the Diameter stack. Different events types are specified for each Diameter request or answer. Events are fired either on client or server activity.</para>
	<!--For peer management, the following messages are defined:</para>
	<itemizedlist>
		<listitem>
			<para>Capabilities-Exchange-Request/Answer (CER/CEA, code: 257)</para>
		</listitem>
		<listitem>

			<para>Disconnect-Peer-Request/Answer (DPR/DPA, code: 282)</para>
		</listitem>
	</itemizedlist>
	<para>For Authentication and Authorization:</para>

	</itemizedlist> -->
	<para>The Activities are defined by <acronym>RA</acronym> Type to ease use of <acronym>RA</acronym>. Activities represent Diameter session between two peers. <acronym>SLEE</acronym> applications use activities to create, send and receive messages.</para>
