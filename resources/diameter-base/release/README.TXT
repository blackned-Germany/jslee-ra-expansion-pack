 Mobicents Diameter : Base Resource Adaptor
============================================
                                v@base_VERSION@

 Welcome to the Mobicents Diameter Base Resource Adaptor v@base_VERSION@ release!

--------------
 Introduction
--------------

 This is the Base RA release of Mobicents Diameter solution.

 This RA provides the Base application (RFC 4006) implementation of Diameter for JAIN SLEE and depends on the Mobicents
 Diameter Mux to be deployed before using it.

 The RA provides the peer management messages (CER-CEA/DWR-DWA/DPR-DPA) and the basic authentication and accounting 
 (ACR-ACA/ASR-ASA/STR-STA/ACR-ACA), including session management, as defined in the RFC.
 
 It can also be used as base for any other application to be developed as it supports raw messages and AVPs, allowing
 it to be extensible for custom applications needs.
