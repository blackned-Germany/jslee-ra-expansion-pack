	<title>Introduction to &THIS.PLATFORM; JAIN SLEE &THIS.RA; Resource Adaptor</title>

	<para>This resource adaptor provides a Diameter API for JAIN SLEE applications, according to S6a interface based on Diameter protocol.</para>
	<para>The S6a reference point is used for location changes of the Mobility Management Entity (<acronym>MME</acronym>), enabling the transfer of subscriber related data between the <acronym>MME</acronym> and the Home Subscriber Server (<acronym>HSS</acronym>).</para>
	<para>The S6a interface application allows a Diameter server and a Diameter client to:
		<itemizedlist>
			<listitem>
				<para>exchange location information;</para>
			</listitem>
			<listitem>
				<para>authorize a user to access the EPS;</para>
			</listitem>
			<listitem>
				<para>exchange authentication information;</para>
			</listitem>
			<listitem>
				<para>download and handle changes in the subscriber data stored in the server.</para>
			</listitem>
		</itemizedlist>
	</para>
	<para>Events represent Diameter S6a messages received by the Diameter stack. Different events types are specified for each Diameter request or answer. Events are fired either on client or server activities.</para>
	<para>The Activities are defined by <acronym>RA</acronym> Type to ease use of <acronym>RA</acronym>. Activities represent Diameter session between two peers. <acronym>SLEE</acronym> applications use activities to create, send and receive messages.</para>
